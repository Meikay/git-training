edit readme

from command line:
create new project directory 
cd into it (get in it)
run git init
run code . to open files
create readme
git add .
git commit

then from github:
create new repo WITHOUT README on github
follow second set of instructions to:
    config remote from command line
    git push -u origin master to set upstream and run first push



refresh github page, and first commit should appear

I'm about to have a merge conflict!
